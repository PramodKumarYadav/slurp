## Goal: 
- Download all comics from website https://comicsworld.in/manga/super-commando-dhruv/


## Objectives
- [ ] Download each jpg page for each comic into its own repository. 
- [ ] Convert all jpg's to pdf files for each comic
- [ ] Make this configurable so that if I want to download any super hero comic, I am able to do that (not just for dhruv)
